          <h2>FDA UPDATE: NEW THERAPY FOR HODGKIN LYMPHOMA PATIENTS</h2><br>
          <h5>By LLS Staffer | March, 2017</h5><br>
          <p>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an immunotherapy for adults and children with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who were not benefiting from existing treatments. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) applauds this approval as an important step forward in ultimately finding a cure for these patients.
<br><br>
While Hodgkin lymphoma is now considered one of the most curable forms of cancer – with a more than 88 percent five-year-survival rate overall – this therapy is for patients who have relapsed after being treated with current therapies, and otherwise have limited treatment options.
<br><br>
The approved therapy, pembrolizumab (Keytruda ®), is among a class of drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which work by removing the brakes that stop the immune system from attacking cancer.
<br><br>
The body’s immune system has T-cells that patrol the body constantly looking for signs of infection or foreign cells (such as cancer cells). Certain proteins on cells indicate if it is healthy or cancerous – and if it is cancerous, the T-cell will attack it. Sometimes the T-cells are unable to recognize the cancer cells because they carry “checkpoint” proteins that act like masks, helping the cancer cells blend in with normal cells.
<br><br>
In this case, the “mask” is a protein called PD-L1, which interacts with another protein, PD-1, allowing cancer cells to evade attack from immune T-cells. The newly approved drug, pembrolizumab, targets PD-1, unleashing the patient’s immune system to fight the cancer. This marks the second FDA approval of a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor for Hodgkin lymphoma patients, with nivolumab (Opdivo ®) approved in May 2016.
<br><br>
FDA based the approval of pembrolizumab on data from a clinical trial of 210 patients who were not benefiting from previous treatment. Within the trial, 69 percent of patients responded positively and 22 percent showed no detectable sign of cancer.
<br><br>
The approval reinforces the hope that immunotherapy will prove useful for a wide variety of cancers, as the drug was previously approved for head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.
<br><br>
Furthermore, LLS is currently funding research studying the benefits of pembrolizumab or nivolumab for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Stephen Ansell, M.D., Ph.D., Mayo Clinic, Margret Shipp, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Sattva Neelapu, M.D., MD Anderson Cancer Center, are leading these research efforts.
